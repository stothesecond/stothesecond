# I drink java while I write it.

***Java was my first programming language*** that I learned 7 years ago. Now I have C/C++, Python, Haskell, JavaScript/Node.js, HTML, CSS/SASS, React.js/Next.js, Svelte, and Angular under my belt.

***I have a passion for algorithms*** and learning about different programming paradigms.

I like to make code that's clear, concise, and reusable in my projects.

I will continue to learn more languages, frameworks, design patterns, and principles.
