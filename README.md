I drink java while I write it.

Java was my first programming language that I learned 4 years ago. Now I have C/C++, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS/SASS, JQuery, React.js/Next.js, Angular, Node.js, Bootstrap, Git, and Haskell under my belt.

I have a passion for algorithms and learning about different programming paradigms. Algorithm optimization is one of my biggest skills, especially when I use my knowledge of mathematics to really push my programs to optimum performance. I also try to make my programs as modular as possible to reuse different parts almost like master puzzle pieces I can use for any puzzle.

There's a certain beauty to front end web development that exactly aligns to my mathematical mind that I didn't see until I started. SPA, responsive design, and modular CSS and JavaScript. I like to see how much elegant reusable code I can make from a project.

My specialties include imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming, developing and applying algorithms in those paradigms, problem solving, optimizing web pages, and responsive design.

I will continue to learn more languages, frameworks, design patterns, and principles because programming is my passion.
